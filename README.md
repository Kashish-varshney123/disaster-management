# Disaster Response Platform 

A backend-heavy MERN stack app for disaster management and response, featuring real-time data aggregation, geospatial queries, social media integration, and robust audit trails.

## Structure
- `/server` — Node.js/Express backend (Supabase, Socket.IO, Gemini API, etc.)
- `/client` — Minimal React frontend (for API testing)

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies in both `/server` and `/client`
2. Configure Supabase and API keys in `/server/.env`
3. Run backend and frontend servers

## Features (Phase 1)
- Disaster CRUD (title, location, description, tags)
- Ownership & audit trails
- Real-time updates
